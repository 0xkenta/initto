## About Dev Dapp Starter Grants

Dev Protocol, Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol from Japan, will be holding “Dev Dapp Starter Grants”, a grant program aimed at aiding the development of blockchain applications (Dapps). The program will provide financial support (paid in DEV token) to the people who are working on Dapp development using Dev Protocol technology, a blockchain technology that allows creators to monetize their creations and gain sustainable support.

The best Dapps will be awarded up to 500 DEV tokens (equivalent to about 1500 USD), which can be used to stake on the Dev Protocol, and will also receive a Certificate of Recognition. The more Dapps we have, the more the ecosystem will expand so we encourage you to submit your own Dapp ideas and work on creating something special! Grant participants will be able to receive a NFT Certificate of Participation.
